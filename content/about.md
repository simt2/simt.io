I am a hybrid. In a room full of software engineers, I'm that infrastructure guy. In the other room full of system administrators, I'm that software developer.

My work is applying the paradigms of software engineering to infrastructure problems, I have always been exposed to both product and systems development simultaneously since early in my career. I am as proficient in automating infrastructure as I am in creating infrastructure products or automation tools themselves, all preferably in Golang.
