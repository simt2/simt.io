I am a hybrid. In a room full of software engineers, I'm that infrastructure guy. In the other room full of system administrators, I'm that software developer.

My work is applying the paradigms of software engineering to infrastructure problems, I have always been exposed to both product and systems development simultaneously since early in my career. I am as good in automating stuff as I am in creating products or tools, both preferably in Golang.

I have taken lead in a team made up of more junior colleagues before and have no problem with researching and taking long-term technical decisions.
